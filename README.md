# haskell-programming-from-first-principles
This repo is for monitoring my progression in reading the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/) by [Christopher Allen](https://twitter.com/bitemyapp) and [Julie Moronuki](https://twitter.com/argumatronic). (I took the links from https://github.com/dwayne/haskell-programming.)

> Most attempts to compare Haskell with other languages only lead to a superficial understanding of the Haskell concepts,
> and making analogies to loops and other such constructs can lead to bad intuitions about how Haskell code works â€¦
> By moving through the exercises and returning to concepts, you can develop a solid intuition for the functional style of programming.
