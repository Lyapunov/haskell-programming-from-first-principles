# haskell-programming-from-first-principles
This repo is for monitoring my progression in reading the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/) by [Christopher Allen](https://twitter.com/bitemyapp) and [Julie Moronuki](https://twitter.com/argumatronic). (I took the links from https://github.com/dwayne/haskell-programming.)
