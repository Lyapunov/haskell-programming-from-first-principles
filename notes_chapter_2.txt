Normal form -- irreducible!

1 + 1 is not irreducible, 2 is irreducible.
redexes : reducible expressions.

evaluation = reduction = normalizing = executing

expressions
 - functions : - for a specific input always the same result
               - one argument. (More arguments via currying.)

   definition, in ghci : let quadro x = x * 4
               in soure: quadro x = x * 4
