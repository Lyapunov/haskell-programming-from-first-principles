Normal form -- irreducible!

1 + 1 is not irreducible, 2 is irreducible.
redexes : reducible expressions.

evaluation = reduction = normalizing = executing

-------

expressions
 - functions : - for a specific input always the same result
               - one argument. (More arguments via currying.)

   definition, in ghci : let quadro x = x * 4
               in soure: quadro x = x * 4
                         name, head, =, body
 
Conventions

   capitalization matters!!!
    - modules and types start with capital.
    - functions start with lowercase letter
   Haskell likes camelCase

   type variables a,b,c..
   functions can be used as arguments: f, g, f1 ...
   variables do not have to be a single letter, though they often are
   arguments to functions x, y, z, x1 ...
   list of x is xs (plural form), (x:xs)
