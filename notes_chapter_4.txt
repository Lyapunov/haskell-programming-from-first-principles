Data declaration
----------------
type level vs. term level (types vs. values)

data Bool = False | True
---  1.     2. 

1. type constructor, the ==capitalized== name of the type
2. pipe separated date constructors, also ==capitalized==!

See :i not vs. not True

Numeric types
-------------
Integral numbers: Int (fixed precision) vs. Integer (arbitrary large)
Fractional: Float (single precision), Double (double precision),
            Rational (arbitrary precise but not efficient),
            Scientific (space-efficient and almost arbitrary precise;
                        coefficient is Integer, exponent is Int)
Num is the superclass all of these

import GHC.Int -> Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64 - n bit precision

See :i (/) or :t (/) - (/) works with a instances having the
                      'Fractional' constraint! 

Comparing values:
> let x = 5
> x == 15, x < 17, x > 13, x /= 14

Constraints again: == requires Eq, < requires Ord.

Comparsions work on strings. It is implied by the list comparsion and
Char comparsion!!! Not an independent mechanism!!!

Bools:
6 different entites have names in Haskell.
   Term-level: values live and executing code during the run of program
               - 1. variables
               - 2. data constructors
   Type-level: for static analysis and verification
               - 3. type variables
               - 4. type constructors
               - 5. typeclasses
               - 6. modules

Ifs:
Haskell doesn't have if statements, but it has if expressions.

   if True then "Mom" else "Dad"

after the if, there must be a Bool (expression). The two branches 
must have compatible types, e.g.
   if False then 1.2 else 2 :: Rational

Storing multiple values within a single value: tuples and lists.

Tuples:
 - fixed number of constituents (pair, triple, four-tuple...)
   === fixed arity
 - fst and snd, only for pair! 
 - swap in Data.Tuple
 - using larger tuples than 5-tuples is insane

Difference between tuples & lists
 1. list costituents must have the same type
 2. they have different syntax, () vs []
 3. list size can change, tuple arity cannot

Lists:
 - we've already seen some operations ((++) and concat and length)

---

why 6 / ( 3 :: Int ) doesn't work? -> cannot div with int
`div`, `quot` works!
