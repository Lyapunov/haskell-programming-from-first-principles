~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Definitions is something like
   data [] a = [] | a : [a]

[] is the type ctor of the list and the data ctor of the empty list. 
: is an infix operator, 'cons' (constructs(.

'The list datatype is either an empty list or a single value

-> Consider the type Maybe for making functions complete and safe
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
